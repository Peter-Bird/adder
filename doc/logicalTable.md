Creating a table with all 16 possible logical functions (or "gates") for two binary inputs involves enumerating every possible combination of inputs and their corresponding outputs. For the functions that don't correspond to traditional gate names, I'll provide a descriptive name or notation. The table below includes the standard gates we've discussed and introduces names for the additional functions where necessary.

Let's denote the inputs as A and B, and the output as F. Here's the complete table:

| ID | Function Name   | Description                   | A | B | F (Output) |
|----|-----------------|-------------------------------|---|---|------------|
| 1  | **TRUE**        | Always true                   | 0 | 0 | 1          |

This table enumerates all 16 possible logical operations for two inputs. Some operations, like "TRUE" and "FALSE," do not depend on the inputs; they always output the same value. Others, like "A" and "B," directly output one of the inputs. This comprehensive set includes every possible way two binary inputs can be combined into a single binary output, demonstrating the versatility and completeness of binary logic operations.
